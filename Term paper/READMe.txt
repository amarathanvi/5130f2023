Comparison of Soap and Rest Web Services 


Abstract: 
The interest on Web services has been growing rapidly from past few years. A web service would be described as a method for exchanging or communicating information between devices over a network. In this Term paper I would describe that which service would fit on the architecture design to develop a product.

Here I will discuss about SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) and REST (Representational State Transfer) which are the two most used protocols to exchange messages, so choosing one over the other has its own advantages and disadvantages. In this paper I will address the differences and best practices when to use one over the other services.
